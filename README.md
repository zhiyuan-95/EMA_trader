# EMA_trader
it is a project that I wrote in my undergrad. I tried to make simple automate trading strategy base on EMA(exponential moving average) by using robinhood api, it trades automatically, but haven't testify if this is profitable
### strategy
I get, and track a basket of the top mover of current stock market, since it has higher volatility, I feel it might has more opportunity. my stratagy is simply just by the stock if smaller EMA > larger EMA, otherwise I sell.
